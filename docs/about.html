                        Section 508 Pro is a best-of-breed, open source digital accessibility dashboard.
                        As a part of a full "human-in-the-loop" solution, it helps identify accessibility
                        issues in your web pages and documents so that designers, testers, and developers
                        can quickly fix them.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        Section 508 Pro is built using free, industry-leading open source solutions.
                        This means that you can focus your budget dollars on solving accessibility problems,
                        not paying for software licenses.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Lighthouse</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/">Lighthouse</a>
                        is an open-source, automated tool from Google for improving the quality of web pages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you have Google Chrome installed, you already have Lighthouse installed as well! Simply visit
                        a web page, right-click anywhere on the page, and choose 'Inspect'. From there,
                        choose Lighthouse and run an audit to get advice on how to improve the web page's
                        performance, accessibility, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Section 508 Pro has already run Lighthouse audits on thousands of US government web pages so
                        you don't have to. But if you ever question the results you see on our website, you can run
                        a Lighthouse audit yourself to verify. That's the beauty of open source solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        You can read a detailed analysis of the "Accessibility State of the Union" on over 8.5 million
                        worldwide public web pages.
